	EASY OPTIMIZATIONS
1. Before me make any changes in our program we should create a base line to make comparison with. If we don't do it, we'll crawl in the darkness asking yourself, wheter there is any use from the changes we've made.
2. Making program we should make write benchmarks and get profiles of our program to use in pprof.
3. There's the good tool called benchcmp: the useful tool to performance comparison before tests.
